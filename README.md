# ARE Review Manual

ARE 4.0 Review Manual/Notes
---

This is the documentation using [MKDocs] for my ARE 4.0 Exam notes. These are not an exhaustive resource, however an ongoing project to document all note taking for future use, and reference from any internet capable device. Trying to move away from hard copy notes as not not have to lug around notes all over the place. 

Also a way of learning [MKDocs] and markdown and taking and organizing a body of information with them, as this is something I'm interested in keeping up for some time as a reference for myself for my work. Feel free to contribute or use for your own. I intend for this to be used as a reference for many years to come, and hopefully other people can find use for it as well. Feel free to post any issues on the [Github Issues] tracker and I will update these notes as fast as I can.
