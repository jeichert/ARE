Grouped classical buildings symmetrically around formal courts of honor, reflecting pools, and large promenades.\n\n\nStarted \nCity Beautiful\n Movement - Revived interest in Urban Planning\n\n\nTypical results - Civic Centers around formal parks, proliferation of classical public buildings, and broad tree lined parkways and streets.\n\n\n1920s - 1930s -\n\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright\n & \nLe Corbusier\n envisioned cities with vast open spaces.\n\n\nBroadacre City\n - \nWright\n - every home should be situated on at least \n1\n acre of land\n\n\nLe Corbusier\n - Envisioned city consisting of office and housing towers surrounded by large green spaces\n\n\nWould have resulted in dull cities and a type of urban sprawl worse than what exists today.\n\n\nNew Town\n - Concept - Extension of idea that entirely new communities can be built away from the crowding and ugliness of existing cities.\n\n\nStarted in Great Britain (1940s) - Spread to United States and elsewhere.\n\n\nNew Towns\n - autonomous centers including housing, shopping, and business, surrounded by a greenbelt.\n\n\nPopulation (originally) - 30,000 - Increased to 70,000 to 250,000 people.\n\n\nNew Towns\n built in England never became independent cities because they lacked significant employment centers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Towns\n of Columbia, Maryland and Reston, Virginia began with the same problems as British.\n\n\nDepended on jobs of nearby Washington D.C. and other areas.\n\n\nThese \nNew Towns\n and other Utopias: Suffered from being Static in their inception and lack the vitality and interest of a city that has evolved over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Urbanism\n - more recent planning philosophy that attempts to counter the many undesirable aspects of city development\n\n\nFactors Including:\n\n\nSuburban sprawl\n\n\nReliance on Automobile\n\n\nEnvironmental Deterioration\n\n\nHousing Segregation\n\n\nLoss of Farmland\n\n\nSingle-Use Development\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBegan in late 1980s because of construction of Seaside, Florida by Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk.\n\n\nAlso developed by:\n\n\nPeter Calthorpe\n\n\nPeter Katz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcepts work at various scales:\n\n\nBuilding\n\n\nNeighborhood\n\n\nDistrict\n\n\nRegional levels in new developments as well as urban and suburban infill projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary urban design features is development of neighborhoods intended for mixed use:\n\n\nHousing within walking distance of shops, offices and other services.\n\n\nVariety of residential types, Apartments above shops, Single-Family Homes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegional Level - Promotes connection of neighborhoods and towns to regional patterns of pedestrian, bicycle and public transit systems while reducing dependence on automobile and establishing connections to open space and natural systems.\n\n\nStreet and Building Level:\n\n\nEncourages individual buildings to be integrated with their surroundings\n\n\nSupport the Street as a place for pedestrians\n\n\nProvide users with a clear sense of location and time.\n\n\nPreservation or reuse of historic structures also supported\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment Patterns\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nUrban development viewed at two scales:\n\n\nLarger scale of city or metropolitan region\n\n\n20th Century:\n\n\nDevelopment determined by geographic features and layout of transportation (highway)\n\n\nCities begun near major geographic feature such as junction of two rivers or large body of water tended to develop along the water and ultimately away from it.\n\n\nAutomobile -> Cities expanded in a few typical patterns. (See \nFigure 2.4\n)\n\n\nWhen in less confined circumstances - grew equally in all directions (uniform grid)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatterns of Development:\n\n\nExpanding Grid\n - City formed at junction of two roads and laid out in the prevalent pattern of Philadelphia (initial plan)\n\n\nGrowth follows grid pattern until natural feature, limiting population or economics stops it.\n\n\nSmaller cities - Strict Grid typical\n\n\nLarger Cities - Follow other patterns but usually infilled with some type of grid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStar Pattern\n - Revolves around urban core. Development follows radiating spokes of main highways or mass transit routes. Higher density development forms around spokes with lower density between.\n\n\nField Pattern\n - No central focus or apparent organization scheme. Development takes place in amorphous network of highways and natural features. (Los Angeles - example)\n\n\nSatellite Pattern\n - Central urban core with other major cores surrounding it. Central core is linked to others with major highways, and often the outer cores are connected with a road system called a beltway. Able to travel center to center or around the city without having to go through core. Outer cores often begin as major shopping areas, peripheral business centers, or transportation centers.\n\n\nMegalopolis\n - Two or more urban centers near each other grow together as the space between is developed. (Northeastern US and Southern California)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmaller scale of the community and neighborhood.\n\n\nScale of planning sites and design buildings.\n\n\nOne idea that is useful in linking the urban scale with the community scale is \nimageability\n - Kevin Lynch\n\n\nImageability\n - quality of a physical environment that gives it a high probability of evoking a strong image in the mind of a given observer.\n\n\nMany large scale elements interwoven with smaller community and neighborhood.\n\n\nHowever there are additional patterns of development that are also intimately related to individual site\n\n\nStreet Pattern. Initially, community and neighborhood development followed the layout of the streets, usually a grid. Blocks between streets were subdivided into lots, and each lot was developed as a separate entity. Other approaches have occurred:\n\n\nSuperBlock - Out growth of new town concept.\n\n\nHenry Wright - Radburn, NJ - One of first using this scheme.\n\n\nLimited automobile intrusion.\n\n\nSurrounded by continuous street, and vehicular access provided by cul-de-sacs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimizes the impact of the car on housing and allows the development of pedestrian circulation and park space within the block\n\n\nBasis for planning of:\n\n\nChandigarh, India - Le Corbusier\n\n\nBrasilia - Lucio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Unit Development (PUD)\n - Large parcel of land - mixed uses\n\n\nResidential\n\n\nCommercial\n\n\nRecreational\n\n\nOpen Space with variable lot sizes and densities\n\n\nIndustrial\n\n\nMust conform to certain standards\n\n\nUses Permitted\n\n\nFloor Area Ration (FAR)\n - Ratio of Developed floor space to land area\n\n\nOpen space Required\n\n\nParking Spaces Required\n\n\nLiving Space Ratio (open space less parking space)\n\n\nMaximum heights\n\n\nSetbacks at perimeter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\nEfficient use of land - Group compatible uses without unnecessary requirements of setback regulations in zoning ordinances.\n\n\nGrouping allows extra land to be given to open space or common use areas.\n\n\nVariety of housing options possible: single-family detached to row houses to high-rise apartments and condos.\n\n\nRecapture some of the diversity and variety of urban living people desire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage of the City\n - \nKevin Lynch\n -\n\n\nFive Basic elements of the urban image:\n\n\nPaths - Way of circulation along which people customarily, occasionally, or potentially move.\n\n\nCould be a street, pedestrian walkway, railroad, transit line, or river.\n\n\nSince they are important part of any physical environment, paths are usually at the center of a person's image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdges\n\n\nLinear elements other than paths that form boundaries between to districts or that break continuity.\n\n\nMay be: Shoreline, line of buildings against park, wall, or similar.\n\n\nCan be seen as a path for circulation up close, but an edge from afar. (I.E. - Highway - Edge of one neighborhood, and a path when one is travelling on it).\n\n\nEither solid or penetrable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistricts\n\n\nTwo Dimensional areas that people perceive as having some common identifying character and that they can enter.\n\n\nCan be perceived from inside if one is in it or it can be identified as an element of the city if one is outside.\n\n\nExamples: Back Bay Boston, and Georgetown in Washington\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNodes\n\n\nStrategic centers of interest that people can enter.\n\n\nMay be the intersections of paths, places where modes of transportation change, plazas, public squares, or centers of districts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLandmarks\n\n\nSimilar to nodes in that they are point references, but people cannot enter them.\n\n\nViewed from exterior. - Tower, monument, building or natural feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreated by buildings, natural features, roads, and other components of the city.\n\n\nSite planning and building design should also respond to existing image elements and enhance them if possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nAbove: Patterns of Urban Development\n\n\nThe Effects of Development Patterns on Social Behavior\n\u00b6",

Grid system became model for later planning in America and the new towns established as the West was settled  Savannah, Georgia (1733):  Based on ward of 40 house lots bounded by major streets in a grid system, and contained and interior square, two sides of which were reserved for public use.  Ordinance of 1785  - Grid System encouraged.  Rectangular survey system  - Divided country into a grid of 24 mi squares - subdivided into 16 townships, each 6 mi on a side -- Subdivided into 36 1 mi^2^ sections.  Washington D.C. - Broke grid system  Layout represented a significant step in city planning.  Pierre Charles L'Enfant  - City Planner/Designer  Based system off of Renaissance and Baroque planning concepts of diagonal and radial streets superimposed on rectangular grid.  Centered on the Capitol, Mall, and executive mansion.  Connected with broad avenues creating coherent transportation system based on vistas terminating in either a building or monument.    Frederick Law Olmstead  - Landscape and Park Design.  One of first landscape designers that preserved the natural features of an area while addressing naturalistic elements.  Calvert Vaux  - Architect.  Teamed up together to design New York's Central Park (1850s) - inspired similar designs for metropolitan parks.    Also Designed Prospect Park in Brooklyn, Riverside Park in New York, Audubon Park in New Orleans, Metropolitan Parks System in Boston, and the grounds of the U.S. Capitol in D.C.  Columbian Exposition  - Chicago (1893) - Designed by Architects - Daniel Burnham & John Root & Landscape Designer Frederick Olmstead.  Grouped classical buildings symmetrically around formal courts of honor, reflecting pools, and large promenades.  Started  City Beautiful  Movement - Revived interest in Urban Planning  Typical results - Civic Centers around formal parks, proliferation of classical public buildings, and broad tree lined parkways and streets.  1920s - 1930s -  Frank Lloyd Wright  &  Le Corbusier  envisioned cities with vast open spaces.  Broadacre City  -  Wright  - every home should be situated on at least  1  acre of land  Le Corbusier  - Envisioned city consisting of office and housing towers surrounded by large green spaces  Would have resulted in dull cities and a type of urban sprawl worse than what exists today.  New Town  - Concept - Extension of idea that entirely new communities can be built away from the crowding and ugliness of existing cities.  Started in Great Britain (1940s) - Spread to United States and elsewhere.  New Towns  - autonomous centers including housing, shopping, and business, surrounded by a greenbelt.  Population (originally) - 30,000 - Increased to 70,000 to 250,000 people.  New Towns  built in England never became independent cities because they lacked significant employment centers.    New Towns  of Columbia, Maryland and Reston, Virginia began with the same problems as British.  Depended on jobs of nearby Washington D.C. and other areas.  These  New Towns  and other Utopias: Suffered from being Static in their inception and lack the vitality and interest of a city that has evolved over time.    New Urbanism  - more recent planning philosophy that attempts to counter the many undesirable aspects of city development  Factors Including:  Suburban sprawl  Reliance on Automobile  Environmental Deterioration  Housing Segregation  Loss of Farmland  Single-Use Development    Began in late 1980s because of construction of Seaside, Florida by Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk.  Also developed by:  Peter Calthorpe  Peter Katz    Concepts work at various scales:  Building  Neighborhood  District  Regional levels in new developments as well as urban and suburban infill projects.    Primary urban design features is development of neighborhoods intended for mixed use:  Housing within walking distance of shops, offices and other services.  Variety of residential types, Apartments above shops, Single-Family Homes      Regional Level - Promotes connection of neighborhoods and towns to regional patterns of pedestrian, bicycle and public transit systems while reducing dependence on automobile and establishing connections to open space and natural systems.  Street and Building Level:  Encourages individual buildings to be integrated with their surroundings  Support the Street as a place for pedestrians  Provide users with a clear sense of location and time.  Preservation or reuse of historic structures also supported",

            "text": "Urban development viewed at two scales:  Larger scale of city or metropolitan region  20th Century:  Development determined by geographic features and layout of transportation (highway)  Cities begun near major geographic feature such as junction of two rivers or large body of water tended to develop along the water and ultimately away from it.  Automobile -> Cities expanded in a few typical patterns. (See  Figure 2.4 )  When in less confined circumstances - grew equally in all directions (uniform grid)    Patterns of Development:  Expanding Grid  - City formed at junction of two roads and laid out in the prevalent pattern of Philadelphia (initial plan)  Growth follows grid pattern until natural feature, limiting population or economics stops it.  Smaller cities - Strict Grid typical  Larger Cities - Follow other patterns but usually infilled with some type of grid.    Star Pattern  - Revolves around urban core. Development follows radiating spokes of main highways or mass transit routes. Higher density development forms around spokes with lower density between.  Field Pattern  - No central focus or apparent organization scheme. Development takes place in amorphous network of highways and natural features. (Los Angeles - example)  Satellite Pattern  - Central urban core with other major cores surrounding it. Central core is linked to others with major highways, and often the outer cores are connected with a road system called a beltway. Able to travel center to center or around the city without having to go through core. Outer cores often begin as major shopping areas, peripheral business centers, or transportation centers.  Megalopolis  - Two or more urban centers near each other grow together as the space between is developed. (Northeastern US and Southern California)    Smaller scale of the community and neighborhood.  Scale of planning sites and design buildings.  One idea that is useful in linking the urban scale with the community scale is  imageability  - Kevin Lynch  Imageability  - quality of a physical environment that gives it a high probability of evoking a strong image in the mind of a given observer.  Many large scale elements interwoven with smaller community and neighborhood.  However there are additional patterns of development that are also intimately related to individual site  Street Pattern. Initially, community and neighborhood development followed the layout of the streets, usually a grid. Blocks between streets were subdivided into lots, and each lot was developed as a separate entity. Other approaches have occurred:  SuperBlock - Out growth of new town concept.  Henry Wright - Radburn, NJ - One of first using this scheme.  Limited automobile intrusion.  Surrounded by continuous street, and vehicular access provided by cul-de-sacs.    Minimizes the impact of the car on housing and allows the development of pedestrian circulation and park space within the block  Basis for planning of:  Chandigarh, India - Le Corbusier  Brasilia - Lucio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer.    Planned Unit Development (PUD)  - Large parcel of land - mixed uses  Residential  Commercial  Recreational  Open Space with variable lot sizes and densities  Industrial  Must conform to certain standards  Uses Permitted  Floor Area Ration (FAR)  - Ratio of Developed floor space to land area  Open space Required  Parking Spaces Required  Living Space Ratio (open space less parking space)  Maximum heights  Setbacks at perimeter.    Advantages:  Efficient use of land - Group compatible uses without unnecessary requirements of setback regulations in zoning ordinances.  Grouping allows extra land to be given to open space or common use areas.  Variety of housing options possible: single-family detached to row houses to high-rise apartments and condos.  Recapture some of the diversity and variety of urban living people desire      Image of the City  -  Kevin Lynch  -  Five Basic elements of the urban image:  Paths - Way of circulation along which people customarily, occasionally, or potentially move.  Could be a street, pedestrian walkway, railroad, transit line, or river.  Since they are important part of any physical environment, paths are usually at the center of a person's image.    Edges  Linear elements other than paths that form boundaries between to districts or that break continuity.  May be: Shoreline, line of buildings against park, wall, or similar.  Can be seen as a path for circulation up close, but an edge from afar. (I.E. - Highway - Edge of one neighborhood, and a path when one is travelling on it).  Either solid or penetrable.    Districts  Two Dimensional areas that people perceive as having some common identifying character and that they can enter.  Can be perceived from inside if one is in it or it can be identified as an element of the city if one is outside.  Examples: Back Bay Boston, and Georgetown in Washington    Nodes  Strategic centers of interest that people can enter.  May be the intersections of paths, places where modes of transportation change, plazas, public squares, or centers of districts.    Landmarks  Similar to nodes in that they are point references, but people cannot enter them.  Viewed from exterior. - Tower, monument, building or natural feature.    Created by buildings, natural features, roads, and other components of the city.  Site planning and building design should also respond to existing image elements and enhance them if possible.",
